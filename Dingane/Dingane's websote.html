                        <p>Eagle Intelligence is a company that will be dealing with camera's that can recognize a person who once committed a crime in our area</p>
                        <p>The drones will be used in the tracking departments and following object in the form of protection and monitoring.</p>
                        <p>If someone tries to commit a crime to an object(example a car) we are protecting and monitorng, then the drone with the camera will see that person and
                            follows him at that moment.

                        <p>If it happens that the person manages to get away, his identification will be stored in our system and therefore he will never set food in all the 
                            departments we are working at. If he goes then our system will identify him as one of our suspected and he will be arrested for the crime he once 
                            committed in one the department we are working at.
